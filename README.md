Hello! This is the Blackjack game version using Vite and Vanilla JavaScript. 
We applied the concept of clean code by using modules and refactoring previously created code. 
One thing I really enjoyed was using JSDocs (already integrated in VS Code), where we worked with function argument types. 
Although Iâ€™ve worked with TypeScript and find it fascinating since it greatly reduces errors, I was able to apply the same principles with Vanilla JavaScript. 
Once again, my goal with this project is to solidify and understand the fundamentals of JavaScript.
